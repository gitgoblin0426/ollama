# Examples

This directory contains different examples of using Ollama

Folders that start with `base-` are the simplest examples of using Ollama. They are meant to be used as a starting point for your own models.

Folders that start with `langchain-` or `llamaindex-` use those tools to integrate Ollama with other tools.

Folders with `python` in the name use Python. Other languages are also used.

To create a model:

```
ollama create example -f <example file>
```

To run a model:

```
ollama run example
```
